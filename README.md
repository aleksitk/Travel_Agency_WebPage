Abstract:
This project focuses on developing a dynamic web application using React for exploring and booking tours in Georgia. The application integrates various features such as tour filtering, sorting, search capabilities, and user authentication. Through the use of React components and React Router, the application provides a seamless user experience for browsing available tours, selecting preferences, and managing user accounts.

Project goals:
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to efficiently search and filter through a diverse range of tours based on criteria such as duration, price range, date, and keywords. Additionally, the project aims to implement sorting functionality to enhance user experience by providing options to sort tours based on price or date. Furthermore, the project includes user authentication features to enable secure sign-up and login processes.

Project description:
Introduction:
The tourism industry in Georgia has seen increasing interest from both local and international tourists. To cater to this demand and facilitate tour discovery and booking, a web application has been developed using React. This application aims to provide a comprehensive platform where users can browse and select from a curated list of tours across various categories.

Task formation:
The main tasks include developing React components for tour cards, search bars, filter menus, sort menus, and user authentication forms. Each component is designed to handle specific functionalities such as displaying tour details, filtering tours based on user preferences, sorting tours according to specified criteria, and enabling user registration and login.

The ways of solutions:
1. React Components: Utilizing reusable React components such as `TourCard`, `FilterMenu`, `SortMenu`, `SearchBar`, `SignIn`, and `SignUp` to modularize and streamline development.
2. State Management: Managing application state using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to handle user inputs, filter criteria, and authentication status.
3. Routing: Implementing client-side routing with React Router (`BrowserRouter`) to navigate between different pages and manage application flow.
4. Styling: Enhancing user interface and experience with custom CSS (`style.css`) to maintain consistent branding and aesthetic across the application.
5. Dynamic Content: Loading data dynamically and asynchronously using `Suspense` and `lazy` loading for efficient resource management and faster initial load times.

Results:
The developed web application successfully meets the project goals by providing a responsive and intuitive platform for users to explore and book tours in Georgia. Users can filter tours by duration, select specific times, set price ranges, search for tours by keywords, and sort results by price or date. The user authentication feature ensures secure access to user-specific functionalities like booking history and personalized recommendations.

Appendixes:
This section includes code fragments from key components such as `FilterMenu`, `SortMenu`, `SearchBar`, `SignIn`, `SignUp`, `TourCard`, `Navbar`, and `ContactPage`. Additionally, screenshots of the application interface, sample figures of tour cards, and tables detailing tour data and booking statistics may be included to provide a comprehensive overview.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, the React-based tour booking application developed for this project demonstrates effective utilization of modern web technologies to create a robust and user-centric platform. The implemented features enhance usability, accessibility, and interactivity, contributing to a seamless user experience in navigating and selecting from a wide range of tours. Future enhancements could include integration with external APIs for real-time pricing updates, further optimization for mobile responsiveness, and additional security features to safeguard user data.
